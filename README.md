# ComplexityMetaAnalyses
This repositiory contains data and code to reproduce meta-analyses on complexity trade-offs and equi-complexity in natural languages.

The original complexity metrics derive from the *Interactive Workshop on Measuring Language Complexity* ([IWMLC](http://christianbentz.de/MLC2019_index.html), organised by K.Ehret, A. Blumenthal-Dram√©, A. Berdicevskis, and C.Bentz) taking place at the *Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies* in September 2019.
See also the respective [github repository](https://github.com/IWMLC/language-complexity-metrics) with results of complexity measurements.
