Reviewer 1:

Nature of contribution
The article provides an interesting quantitative analysis of
linguistic complexity from different perspectives: trade-off and
equi-complexity.

Specific strengths/ weaknesses
The article is very well written and nice to read. The used methods
and data are clearly provided and allow the readers to follow what was
done.

Appropriateness of the article
The paper definitely fits the special issue on linguistic complexity.

Steps to improve
While the article is limited in terms of space, a few details could be
further clarified. Moreover, the conclusion of the article oversells a
bit the results. More details are provided in the comments below.

Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that the general evaluation on
the article is positive :-)

Further comments to the Author

As said in the general comments, this is a very well written paper,
which provides the materials and code. The general evaluation of the
paper is positive. If most articles were written in such a clear way,
it would make the reviewing process much smoother in general.

Nevertheless, I still have some comments on the reported results and
the methods. In general, I feel that the authors are a bit overselling
the results:

- The features of the shared task were directly imported in the data
for the analysis, which has an effect on the output of the analysis.
For instance, several features are probably auto-correlated by
definition, e.g., SI_dep_dl, SI_double_dl, and SI_head_dl. Doing a PCA
on these features could be helpful to visualize how the features
interact. But more importantly, this has a direct impact on the
interpretation of the results: on p13: "The strongest examples of
positive correlations stem from the domain of morphology, suggesting
that here different researchers largely agree in their
operationalization of complexity" and on p17: "To conclude this
section: We find that roughly half (48%) of the significant Spearman
correlations for pairs of measures are negative. Hence, there is
considerable evidence for complexity trade-offs.". a) Since the
features were not filtered, it is likely that the amount of positive
and negative correlations might be inflated by chance b) likewise, the
amount of positive correlations in a domain might also be positively
or negatively inflated. As a more detailed example, to really say that
most researchers agree on how to measure morphological complexity, it
would be necessary to know which measures were generated by which team
and control for that during the testing. I am not saying that this
should be done here, but it should at least be clearly mentioned as a
limitation.

- p18: Figure 6 is not readable unless with a big zoom in, I suggest
to make it larger or have it as landscape on an entire page.
Furthermore, the density here is also likely to be influenced by the
choice of the features, as mentioned in the preceding comment.

- P19 :"More generally, in all 946 pairwise tests for overall
complexity shifts between these 44 languages, we find only 6 (0.006%)
cases whereùëù <0.05. ": I am not really understanding what was
compared pairwisely here. Could you explain it a bit more?

- P21: "We have here presented a meta-analysis of complexity
measurements across 79 typologically diverse language of 34 families":
This is extremely overselling the diversity of the data, as most of
the output is based on Track B from the UD, which is largely biased
toward Indo-European languages. This limitation should be clarified in
the text.

- The output is based on simple correlation tests, which do not
control for the effects of family or area or researcher who created
the measures. This should be clearly mentioned in the limitations

Reviewer 2:

Nature of contribution
The aurthors analyze the results of the first Interactive Workshop on
Measuring Language Complexity (IWMLC) held in Freiburg in 2019.1 In
the workshop, seven teams of researches had the shared task to assess
the complexity of languages using measures of their choice.

The paper proposes to take the diversity of viewpoints with regards to
linguistic complexity as a given, and to capture the complexity of a
language by a vector of measurements, rather than a single value.

The authors assess the statistical support for two controversial
hypotheses: the trade-off hypothesis and the equi-complexity
hypothesis. To this end, they furnish a meta-analysis of 33 complexity
metrics applied to texts written in 79 languages of 34 families.

The trade-off hypothesis is partially supported, in the sense that
half of the significant correlations between measures are negative.
The equi-complexity hypothesis, on the other hand, is largely
confirmed. While the authors find evidence for complexity differences
in the subdomains of morphology and syntax, overall complexity vectors
of even typologically diverse languages turn out virtually
indistinguishable.

Specific strengths/ weaknesses
Strengths
- a large variety of measures for complexity
- a somewhat large variety of languages (79)
- clear definitions and measures
- some new insights

Weaknesses
- corpora are smallish
- variety of languages could be increased

Appropriateness of the article
The paper seems highly appropriate for the journal, as it offers an up
to date review of morphological and syntactic complexity with a large
variety of methods  and clear results

Steps to improve
I don't have suggestions
